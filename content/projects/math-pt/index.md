  The use of large language models (LLMs) for complex mathematical reasoning is an emergent area of research, with fast progress in methods, models, and benchmark datasets. However, most mathematical reasoning evaluations exhibit a significant linguistic bias, with the vast majority of benchmark datasets being exclusively in English or (at best) translated from English. We address this limitation by introducing Math-PT, a novel dataset comprising 1,729 mathematical problems written in European and Brazilian Portuguese. Math-PT is curated from a variety of high-quality native sources, including mathematical Olympiads, competitions, and exams from Portugal and Brazil. We present a comprehensive benchmark of current state-of-the-art LLMs on Math-PT, revealing that frontier reasoning models achieve strong performance in multiple choice questions compared to open weight models, but that their performance decreases for questions with figures or open-ended questions. To facilitate future research, our benchmark dataset will be publicly released, along with the model outputs.
