  Sheaf neural networks (SNNs) leverage cellular sheaves to induce flexible diffusion processes on graphs, generalizing the diffusion mechanism of classical graph neural networks. While SNNs have been shown to cope well with heterophilic tasks and alleviate oversmoothing, we argue that there is further room for improving sheaf diffusion. More specifically, we show that SNNs do not allow nodes to independently choose how they cooperate with their neighbors, i.e., whether they convey and/or gather information to/from their neighbors. To address this issue, we first introduce the notion of cellular sheaves over directed graphs and characterize their in- and out-degree Laplacians. We then leverage our construction to propose Cooperative Sheaf Neural Network (CSNN). Additionally, we formally characterize its receptive field and prove that it allows nodes to selectively attend (listen) to arbitrarily far nodes while ignoring all others in their path, which is key to alleviating oversquashing. Our results on synthetic data empirically substantiate our claims, showing that CSNN can handle long-range interactions while avoiding oversquashing. We also show that CSNN performs strongly in heterophilic node classification and long-range graph classification benchmarks.
