[Condor Camp](condor.camp) was an amazing event on AI Safety that happened on Mexico City. There I learned and discussed about topics related to AI Governance and Technical AI Safety. I was also introduced to some [EA](effectivealtruism.org) philosophy, which have some compelling ideias. Probably the best experience I've had about how I can use my career to make a real impact on the world.
