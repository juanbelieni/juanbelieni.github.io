[Condor Camp](https://condor.camp) was an amazing event on AI safety that happened in Mexico City. There, I learned and discussed topics related to AI governance and technical AI safety. I was also introduced to the [effective altruism](https://effectivealtruism.org) philosophy. It was probably the best experience regarding career planning as well.
