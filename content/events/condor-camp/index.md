[Condor Camp](condor.camp) was an amazing event on AI safety that happened on Mexico City. There I learned and discussed about topics related to AI governance and technical AI safety. I was also introduced to the [effective altruism](effectivealtruism.org) philosophy, which have some compelling ideias. Probably the best experience I've had about how I can use my career to make a real impact on the world.
